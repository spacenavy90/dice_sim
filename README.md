Simple dice pool attack/defense simulator.

Includes CLI or GUI versions (GUI requires matplotlib installed).
To run, in a console type 'python dice_sim_cli.py' or 'python dice_sim_gui.py'.

Upon running, it will ask you for the number of dice being rolled.
Then it will ask for the hit value to meet or exceed (1 to 6).
It will simulate 1 attack pool roll (and also 100, giving you the average result).
From here you can manually adjust the amount of successes/hits.

Then it will ask for the defense value to meet or exceed (1 to 6).
Again, it will simulate 1 defense pool roll (and also 100, giving you the average result) along with a summary of the hits, saves and wounds caused.
Run the program again to start over.
